# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** 01/08/2026

Welcome to **Yandere Test** ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your personal information is collected, used, and disclosed by Yandere Test.

By accessing or using our Service (yanderetest.com), you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to our collection, storage, use, and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service.

## 1. Information We Collect

### A. Information You Provide Voluntarily
*   **Quiz Responses:** When you take our test, we collect the answers you select to calculate your results (e.g., Yandere Score, Archetype).
*   **Payment Information:** If you choose to unlock the full report, our third-party payment processor (**Creem**) will collect your payment details (email, credit card information). **We do not store your full credit card information on our servers.**
*   **Email Address:** If you make a purchase, we (or our payment processor) collect your email address to send you the receipt and a link to retrieve your results.

### B. Information Collected Automatically
*   **Local Storage:** We use your browser's Local Storage to save your unique "Result ID" so you can retrieve your test results later without needing to create an account.
*   **Usage Data:** We may use standard analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics) to collect non-personal information about how you use the website, such as pages visited, time spent on the site, and device type.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:
*   Calculate and display your test results.
*   Process transactions and unlock premium content.
*   Send you emails regarding your order (e.g., result backup links).
*   Improve our website functionality and user experience.
*   Detect and prevent fraudulent transactions.

## 3. Third-Party Services

We may share information with third-party vendors who provide services on our behalf, such as:
*   **Payment Processing:** We use **Creem.io** to process payments. Their use of your personal information is governed by their privacy policy.
*   **Analytics:** We may use third-party analytics services to help understand website traffic.

## 4. Data Retention and Security

We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure.

Since we do not require user accounts, your test results are linked to a unique ID. If you clear your browser cache or lose your Result ID URL, you may lose access to your free results. Paid results can be retrieved via the email provided at checkout.

## 5. Children's Privacy

Our Service is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete that information.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
