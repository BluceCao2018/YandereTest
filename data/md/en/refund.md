# Refund Policy

**Last Updated:** January 9, 2026

Thank you for purchasing the Yandere Diagnosis Report at **yanderetest.com**.

We take pride in the quality of our psychological analysis and content. However, because our products are **digital goods** delivered via Internet download/instant unlock, we generally do not offer refunds once the purchase is completed and the content has been accessed.

Please read this policy carefully before making a purchase.

### 1. General Policy: All Sales Final
Due to the nature of digital content (instant access and non-returnable), **all sales are considered final and non-refundable.**

Once you have unlocked the full report, the "Dark Stats," or the "Compatibility Match," the service is considered fully rendered. We do not offer refunds for "change of mind" or if you simply disagree with your test results.

### 2. Exceptions (When We DO Offer Refunds)
We want to be fair. We **WILL** issue a full refund under the following specific circumstances:

*   **Duplicate Payment:** You were accidentally charged twice for the same transaction.
*   **Technical Failure:** You paid for the report, but a technical error prevented you from accessing or viewing your results, and our support team was unable to fix the issue for you within 24 hours.
*   **Fraudulent Transaction:** If the purchase was made without your consent (e.g., stolen card), please contact us immediately.

### 3. Non-Refundable Scenarios
We do **NOT** offer refunds for the following reasons:

*   **Subjective Dissatisfaction:** You did not like your Yandere Score, Archetype, or the advice given. The test is for entertainment and self-discovery purposes based on an algorithm; results may vary.
*   **Failure to Read:** You expected a different product despite the description provided on the homepage and checkout page.
*   **Unused Access:** You purchased the report but decided not to read it.

### 4. How to Request a Refund
If you believe your case qualifies for a refund under Section 2, please contact us within **7 days** of your purchase.

*   **Email:** [support@yanderetest.com] (Replace this with your email)
*   **Subject Line:** Refund Request - [Your Order ID]

Please include your **Order ID** (found in your email receipt) and a brief description of the issue.

### 5. Processing Time
If your refund is approved, we will initiate the refund to your original method of payment (via Creem/Stripe). You will receive the credit within a certain amount of days, depending on your card issuer's policies.
